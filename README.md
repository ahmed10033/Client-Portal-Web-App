# Client Portal Web App

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary
The **Client Portal Web App** is a full-stack web application designed to simulate a real-world SaaS-like solution. It allows service providers (Admins) to interact with their clients, manage tasks or deliverables, exchange files, and communicate through a structured dashboard.

This project is developed as part of a **Software Engineering course** to enhance practical skills in frontend, backend, and database development while working in a collaborative team environment.
